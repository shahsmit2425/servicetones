## Data and authorization

Firebase proves identity. Every API request verifies the ID token, checks revocation and verified email, and loads the user's role from PostgreSQL. Registration accepts only customer or professional; an administrator must also possess a Firebase admin claim. URL changes never change account permissions.

PostgreSQL stores users, profiles, projects, estimates, messages, payments, reviews, support tickets, notifications, blocked/saved relationships, private file references, audit events, webhook receipts and the email outbox. Migrations contain no INSERT statements for marketplace data. The legacy SQLite/localStorage preview is not loaded, migrated, or served.

Private workspace queries are scoped to the current user. Administrators can manage listings, cases and financial records but do not automatically receive private messages or project attachments. Public searches and profile pages only show verified, unsuspended listings. Provider opportunities omit customer identity until assignment.

Projects use requested → quoted → booked → in_progress → completed, with explicit cancellation/dispute paths. Commands lock the project row, validate actor and stage, and update quotes and notifications in the same transaction. Monetary totals are integer USD cents. Checkout prices come from the accepted estimate, never the browser. Each project can have one payment record and one review.

## Integrations and consistency

Stripe handles hosted Identity, Express Connect onboarding, Checkout destination charges, receipts and full refunds. Verification is updated only by matching a signed event to the stored verification session. Payment success is updated by signed webhooks, not a redirect. Event IDs, payment uniqueness and Stripe idempotency keys protect retries.

Daily issues project-specific private rooms and short-lived participant tokens. Calls open in the system/browser calling surface; camera and microphone permission is requested by that surface. This is a foreground calling flow, not native background ringing or push calling.

R2 uploads use short-lived signed URLs, project ownership checks, type/size allowlists, and a final object inspection. Buckets are private and downloads use short-lived URLs. Identity documents are never uploaded through R2.

Upstash provides shared per-user throttling; Express also limits requests per IP. PostgreSQL is the source of truth. The email worker consumes an outbox with row locks, exponential retry and an eight-attempt limit. Email delivery is at-least-once: a process failure after delivery but before acknowledgment can produce a duplicate alert.

The UI refreshes current data every ten seconds and on focus. This keeps web/mobile state consistent through the same backend; it is not a WebSocket push transport. Clients show loading/errors and do not claim success until the API succeeds.

## Environment model

All branches contain identical environment-independent application code after promotion. Runtime values come from Render groups. Web clients receive only the explicitly allowlisted `/api/config` fields. Mobile builds obtain that public config from the matching deployed SHA and bundle it with the same source commit. Private keys are never embedded in JavaScript.

Native app code updates still require new signed builds and installation through the relevant store/test channel. Backend and website changes become available after Render deployment. There is no unsafe remote-code hot-patch mechanism.

## SEO and accessibility

Public landing, six service pages and verified professional profiles are server-rendered HTML with titles, descriptions, canonical links, Open Graph and JSON-LD. Sitemap URLs include real public profiles only. Non-production environments and private application routes are noindex; missing pages return 404. Do not treat robots directives as an access-control boundary.

The shared stylesheet uses dark headings and readable body colors, responsive navigation, visible focus outlines, form labels, status/error announcements, and reduced-motion support. No synthetic ratings, job counts or customer testimonials are displayed.
